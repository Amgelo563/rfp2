CHANGELOG

    v1.3.1:
        - Added compatibility api documentation to the source root
        - Relaxed mod blacklisting checks and allowed them to be bypassed at the user's discretion
        - Removed Ido from blacklist
        - Added support for "Ido" movement mod (https://github.com/Kaydax/Ido)
        - Added changelog to the source root
        - Refactored mechanism for fixing conflicts with other mods -- code is now modular and it should be easier to add fixes going forward.

    v1.2.3:
        - Mod blacklist added due to numerous reports certain mods that I cannot fix compatibility with easily. If known conflicting mods are present, RFP2 will not load, and will display a warning message.
        - Added the following mods to the blacklist: obfuscate, ido, moreplayermodels, playerformlittlemaid
        - Added logging rate limiting for when the "ignore rendering errors" option is checked.
 
    v1.2.2:
        - Morph mod integration (RFP2 will disable itself while you are morphed)
        - Added an experimental option to bypass rendering safety checks for those who keep having RFP2 switch itself off unnecessarily. (Game may crash with this enabled, you have been warned!)
        - Added Compatibility API for other mods to interact with RFP2
        
    v1.1.0:
        - Added Cosmetic Armor Reworked integration
        - Fixed first person rendering bug that caused visual problems with CarryOn and similar mods that affect first person poses
        
    v1.0.0:
        - Added Configurable hotkeys to toggle mod features
        - Body now follows camera facing direction by default (can be toggled with hotkey)
        - Mod no longer changes F1 HUD toggle functionality
        - Near-instant startup of first person effect after logging in, teleporting, or respawning
        - Improved forge integration, including in-game config GUI
        - Improved compatibility options, see in-game options menu for full details
